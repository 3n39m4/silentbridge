## Overview

Silentbridge is a toolkit for quickly bypassing 802.1x port security first presented at DEF CON 26. It improves upon existing techniques for bypassing 802.1x-2004, and some new techniques for attacking both 802.1x-2004 and 802.1x-2010 via their authentication process.

You can check out the accompanying PowerPoint slides, blog, and whitepaper at [https://digitalsilence.com/blog](https://digitalsilence.com/blog). A link to the recorded talk will be added to the blog post when made available by DEF CON.
